.. py:module:: crapssim.strategy

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Strategies to be assigned to players on the Craps table. The strategy determines what bets the

   is going to make, remove, or change.


   .. py:method:: after_roll(player: Player) -> None

      Update the Strategy after the dice are rolled but before the bets and the table are updated.

      For example, if you wanted to know whether the
      point changed from on to off you could do `self.point_lost = table.point.status = "On" and
      table.dice.roll.total == 7`. You could not do this in :func:`Strategy`'s :func:`update_bets`
      method, since the table has already been updated setting the point's status to Off. Other examples
      include counting the number of place bets that had won after the roll, counting total winnings
      for certain bets, or recording the starting bankroll upon a new shooter (to later have logic
      based on winnings of that shooter).

      :param player: The Player to check for bets, etc.



   .. py:method:: completed(player: Player) -> bool
      :abstractmethod:


      If True, the Strategy is completed and the Player stops playing. If False, the Player
      keeps playing the Strategy.



   .. py:method:: update_bets(player: Player) -> None
      :abstractmethod:


      Add, remove, or change the bets on the table.

      This method is applied after the dice are rolled, the bets are updated,
      and the table is updated. It triggers in :py:meth:`.table.TableUpdate.run_strategies`.
